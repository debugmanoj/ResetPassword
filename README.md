# Sign In and  Sign Up app using custom made API

1.This Form app directs to home page were user can be able to create mail id and password

# Feature: user Entered password does not store as simple plain text it will hashed then store on database

2.Next Sign in page were user can use there email id and password to log in as a development process still sign in will not work but you can reset the password using the reset password button

3.When you can see the reset password page user need to input their email id and token will generated to the page copy  generated token and click on the change password button

# Feature : The joken was autogenerated using jswebtoken

4.In reset password page if you used wrong token  it will not allow to reset password so kindly input the same token which was previously generated 

I hope the above details will make to work on my app
